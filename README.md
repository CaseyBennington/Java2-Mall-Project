# Java2-Mall-Project
Coursework for VWCC Java2 Mall Project.


This project will simulate a Mall.  It contains an overall Mall with
multiple stores each with multiple items for sale within.
The user is able to start off with some fake data and proceed with
the program.  They may also add an item or add a customer.
They may pick a customer to shop with by selecting a cart for a customer
and then proceeding to shop to their hearts content.

The user would then select to checkout their cart,
thus purchasing those items they choose.
The user can then save a serialized file and read back in said file
as a method of persistent data collection.

Enjoy.

NOTE: Be sure to read each output to know what the program
is looking for as input.
